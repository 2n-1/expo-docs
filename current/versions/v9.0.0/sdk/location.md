This module allows reading geolocation information from the device. Your app can poll for the current location or subscribe to location update events.

### `Exponent.Location.getCurrentPositionAsync(options)`
Get the current position of the device.

#### Arguments

* **options (_object_)** --

    A map of options:

  * **enableHighAccuracy (_boolean_)** -- Whether to enable high-accuracy mode. For low-accuracy the implementation can avoid geolocation providers that consume a significant amount of power (such as GPS).

#### Returns

Returns an object with the following fields:

* **coords (_object_)** -- The coordinates of the position, with the following fields:
  * **latitude (_number_)** -- The latitude in degrees.
  * **longitude (_number_)** -- The longitude in degrees.
  * **altitude (_number_)** -- The altitude in meters above the WGS 84 reference ellipsoid.
  * **accuracy (_number_)** -- The radius of uncertainty for the location, measured in meters.
  * **altitudeAccuracy (_number_)** -- The accuracy of the altitude value, in meters (iOS only).
  * **heading (_number_)** -- Horizontal direction of travel of this device, measured in degrees starting at due north and continuing clockwise around the compass. Thus, north is 0 degrees, east is 90 degrees, south is 180 degrees, and so on.
  * **speed (_number_)** -- The instantaneous speed of the device in meters per second.
* **timestamp (_number_)** -- The time at which this position information was obtained, in milliseconds since epoch.

Â 
### `Exponent.Location.watchPositionAsync(options, callback)`
Subscribe to location updates from the device.

#### Arguments

* **options (_object_)** --

    A map of options:

  * **enableHighAccuracy (_boolean_)** -- Whether to enable high accuracy mode. For low accuracy the implementation can avoid geolocation providers that consume a significant amount of power (such as GPS).
  * **timeInterval (_number_)** -- Minimum time to wait between each update in milliseconds.
  * **distanceInterval (_number_)** -- Receive updates only when the location has changed by at least this distance in meters.

* **callback (_function_)** --

    This function is called on each location update. It is passed exactly one parameter: an object with the following fields:

  * **coords (_object_)** -- The coordinates of the position, with the following fields:
    * **latitude (_number_)** -- The latitude in degrees.
    * **longitude (_number_)** -- The longitude in degrees.
    * **altitude (_number_)** -- The altitude in meters above the WGS 84 reference ellipsoid.
    * **accuracy (_number_)** -- The radius of uncertainty for the location, measured in meters.
    * **altitudeAccuracy (_number_)** -- The accuracy of the altitude value, in meters (iOS only).
    * **heading (_number_)** -- Horizontal direction of travel of this device, measured in degrees starting at due north and continuing clockwise around the compass. Thus, north is 0 degrees, east is 90 degrees, south is 180 degrees, and so on.
    * **speed (_number_)** -- The instantaneous speed of the device in meters per second.
  * **timestamp (_number_)** -- The time at which this position information was obtained, in milliseconds since epoch.

#### Returns

Returns a subscription object, which has one field:

* **remove (_function_)** -- Call this function with no arguments to remove this subscription. The callback will no longer be called for location updates.
