### 1. Expo is just regular React Native.

Expo is the easiest and best way to get going using React Native, not an alternative to React Native.

### 2. Completely free and open source

The source code for our clients and our SDK is completely free and open source, so you can always fig in and figure out what's going on, and we make it as easy to move away from Expo if it doesn't do everything you need so there's no reason to not start with Expo.

### 3. You don't have to deal with Xcode or Android Studio or Objective-C or Swift or Java.

With Expo, you just write JavaScript and Expo takes care of all the native code for you.

### 4. You can develop for iPhone on a Windows or Linux machine

Since you don't need Xcode to use Expo.

### 5. The most popular native modules are included

Many of your favorite native modules are already built in to Expo and you can use them right away. Native maps (Google Maps, Apple Maps), Facebook login, Google login, Amplitude and Segment analytics, Facebook ads, OpenGL graphics, an inline video player, camera access, push notifications, and access to contacts are all built in.

### 6. Easy sharing

While you're working on Expo projects, you have a URL you can open on your own phone or send to a friend or collaborator to try. When you're ready, you can publish your project to a permanent URL that your friends can use to try the project.

### 7. One command App Store builds

When you're ready to turn your project into an app and put it in the iOS App Store and/or Google Play Store, you can run one command and have an IPA or APK ready for submission to the App Store for any published project.

### 8. Built-in Instant Updates

When you publish new versions of your project, your apps will update instantly -- without the user having to download a new version from the App Store -- using the mechanism that specifically follows Apple's rules. You can fix bugs and add new features in seconds whenever you need to.

### 9. No lock in.

If you end up needing to write your own native code to do something that Expo can't, you can use ExpoKit to eject and get an Xcode project and Android Studio project where you can write your own native code but keep all the other features you like about Expo like instant updates and all the built in native functionality.

If you want to get rid of Expo entirely, you can do that. All your code is just regular React Native code that you can take and put into a different React Native project.

### 10. Painless Upgrades

One of the most frustrating and time consuming parts of building and maintaining a React Native app is upgrading to newer versions of React Native. By providing a single binary that can work with different versions of React Native and taking care of and maintaining all the popular native modules for you, Expo makes upgrading to the latest versions of React Native a breeze.
