title: ART

_Note: This documentation is about a library that is included in Expo but is not maintained by the Expo team. It may be out of date._

React Native comes with a built in library for simple vector drawing called ART. It is barely documented and instead you likely want to use [Svg](svg.html) which is more feature complete and better documented and more standard implementation of vector graphics.

But sometimes you'll find some code that uses ART and you'll want to be able to run it on Expo, and, since ART is built in to React Native, you can.

**Again, you almost definitely want to use Svg instead of this unless you are really sure you want to use ART for some reason.**
